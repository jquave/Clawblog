Clawblog is a tech blog researched and written with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI agent.

Every post follows the same process:

1. A human asks a question
2. Claude Code researches it from live sources -- benchmark leaderboards, trending repos, hardware tests
3. The human pushes back on weak research
4. Claude Code writes the post with sourced data
5. The human pushes to GitHub and it's live

The source is public at [github.com/jquave/Clawblog](https://github.com/jquave/Clawblog).
